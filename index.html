    See the problem...
    With Lil Pump compared to Fetty Wap is
    Lil Pump does not respect women! 
    But Fetty Wap...
    He Does!
    Look at the difference between Gucci Gang and Trap Queen
    Lil Pump says
    I can't buy a bitch a wedding ring!
    Cause he'd rather spend his money on balmains!
    He doesn't respect them but Fetty Wap
    He's gonna drop a couple on a ring!
    That's a lucky lady!
